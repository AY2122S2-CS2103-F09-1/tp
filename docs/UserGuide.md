## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/PG` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/SF`, `t/PF t/C` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you have specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as help.
