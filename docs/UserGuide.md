MyGM is a **desktop app for high school basketball team trainers to manage players’ contacts and data, optimized for use
via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, MyGM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `MyGM.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MyGM. **Put the JAR file in an empty folder in which the app is allowed to create files (i.e., do not use a write-protected folder). You can copy it to your desktop or just leave it in your Downloads folder.**

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds (note that there might be slight difference in different OS).<br>
The GUI is split into two parts: Players and Schedules. <br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png) ![Ui2](images/Ui2.png) <br>
Details of the GUI are shown below![Ui_Players](images/UiPlayers.png) ![Ui_Schedule](images/UiSchedule.png)<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`add`**`P/ n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com h/183 w/70 j/24 t/PG` : Adds a player named `John Doe` to MyGM.

   * **`add`**`S/ n/training r/shooting training d/01/01/2023 1800` : Adds a schedule called `training` to MyGM.

   * **`delete`**`P/John Doe` : Deletes John Doe from MyGM.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all players, lineup and schedule.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/PG` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/SF`, `t/PF t/C` etc.
* Commands are case sensitive. `Add` is considered as invalid command, the correct command should be in lower case.
* Parameters are case sensitive. `John Doe` and `joHN dOE` are considered as different people.
* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you have specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as help.
